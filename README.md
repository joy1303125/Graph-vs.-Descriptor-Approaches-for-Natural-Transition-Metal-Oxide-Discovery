# Graph-vs.-Descriptor-Approaches-for-Natural-Transition-Metal-Oxide-Discovery
Our repo predicts formation energy via descriptors (X-ray, Magpie) and graphs (3 GNNs). Models like MEGNet, ALIGNN, and DeeperGATGNN (GitHub: https://github.com/usccolumbia/deeperGATGNN) enhance formation energy prediction for transitional metal oxide materials. It will help to discover new materials later on.
